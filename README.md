# Sistema-Agendamento-Front

  I'm currently managing an Auto Center. Given the large number of vehicles serviced weekly, we realized the need to start working with service scheduling for the vehicles. <br>
  I created this application with that in mind: a way to facilitate and keep a record of scheduled, canceled, and completed appointments. <br>
  The application will have a Front-end developed with Angular v17 and a Back-end with NodeJS + Express and MongoDB as the database (for which I will create a new repository to avoid visual clutter). So far, I have only completed the Login part of the Front-end, and I will commit the rest as I finish the application. <br>
  I did not focus much on the designs, layouts, colors, and fonts, because I preferred to pay more attention to the Back-end (given the concern with data registration and security). <br>
  I was inspired by some YouTube videos and codes from some close colleagues.

   I hope I can get some feedback on my code or maybe even help someone by answering questions and so on.

  See ya!
